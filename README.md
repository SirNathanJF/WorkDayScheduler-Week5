SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

# Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My Experience
```
This homework felt really good. It helped me to understand jQuery a bit better and to really enjoy the bootstrap and fontawesome items that we had learned about. I think that the hardest part on this assignment for me was to find the save icon that I could see in the example. I stumbled across it when I saw that fontawesome was linked. I also struggled a bit with the prenamed CSS classes that were provided and having to juggle back and forth between the three files to make sure everything was styled correctly. Overall this was pretty fun.
